# Teaching Tips and reflections

This is a place where my planned teaching strategies are going to be stored along with weekly objectives for the teaching seminar class:

## **Week 03**

Part 1: Two ways you plan on using the information you read about in the future. 

-   When designing a first class in last week's discussion I mentioned in my plan asking students to make predictions about what psychology encompasses. Base on this weeks reading I plan on incorporating this prediction model in future classes.

-   I plan on adopting a more engaging behavior before the beginning of class, trying to interact more with all students, to make sure I am not favoring only a few students, or seeming unavailable by keeping to myself.

Part 2: Two measurable learning outcomes for that day’s class. I want you to imagine you are the professor for this grad seminar and think about the two most important learning outcomes you would want your students to obtain by the end of class that day.

-   I want to understand how to provide praise with caution to avoid inhibiting participation from other students

-   Lean how to explicitly mention pursuit for equity in the classroom and goals of active learning/ teaching without sounding illegitimate or uninteresting to students.

## **Week 04**

Part 1: Two ways you plan on using the information you read about in the future. 

-   I plan on incorporating both activation of counter misconceptions and concept test, along with other techniques similar to the steps mentioned by the author. I want to present the students with the question, give them time to think about it, collect their answer anonymously, give them time to discuss their answers with a peer, then collect answers again, this time visible to the whole class. My last step would be to ask someone that had a different answer to explain it to me, then provide a conceptual explanation of why that is incorrect. (unsure if that would hinder future participation)

-   I plan on adding a concept map to any course I can potentially teach and build on it through the whole semester. When introducing a new topic asking students where it could go on the concept map given its description.

-   Extra: I wanted to also have students feel out their own cheat sheet for a class like stats, after every class(or every week) as homework, in which they had to add the most important concepts that they learned and explain why they are relevant and in which contexts it should be used.

Part 2: Two measurable learning outcomes for that day’s class. I want you to imagine you are the professor for this grad seminar and think about the two most important learning outcomes you would want your students to obtain by the end of class that day.

-   What are the best frameworks to work from for different types of content (Statistics, Intro to Psy, History)

-   How to balance time spent correcting misconceptions and practice through peer interaction, with the time needed to present the content that needs to be covered

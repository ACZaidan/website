# Teaching Tips and reflections

This is a place where my planned teaching strategies are going to be stored along with weekly objectives for the teaching seminar class:

## **Week 03**

Part 1: Two ways you plan on using the information you read about in the future. 

-   When designing a first class in last week's discussion I mentioned in my plan asking students to make predictions about what psychology encompasses. Base on this weeks reading I plan on incorporating this prediction model in future classes.

-   I plan on adopting a more engaging behavior before the beginning of class, trying to interact more with all students, to make sure I am not favoring only a few students, or seeming unavailable by keeping to myself.

Part 2: Two measurable learning outcomes for that day’s class. I want you to imagine you are the professor for this grad seminar and think about the two most important learning outcomes you would want your students to obtain by the end of class that day.

-   I want to understand how to provide praise with caution to avoid inhibiting participation from other students

-   Lean how to explicitly mention pursuit for equity in the classroom and goals of active learning/ teaching without sounding illegitimate or uninteresting to students.

## **Week 04**

Part 1: Two ways you plan on using the information you read about in the future. 

-   I plan on incorporating both activation of counter misconceptions and concept test, along with other techniques similar to the steps mentioned by the author. I want to present the students with the question, give them time to think about it, collect their answer anonymously, give them time to discuss their answers with a peer, then collect answers again, this time visible to the whole class. My last step would be to ask someone that had a different answer to explain it to me, then provide a conceptual explanation of why that is incorrect. (unsure if that would hinder future participation)

-   I plan on adding a concept map to any course I can potentially teach and build on it through the whole semester. When introducing a new topic asking students where it could go on the concept map given its description.

-   Extra: I wanted to also have students feel out their own cheat sheet for a class like stats, after every class(or every week) as homework, in which they had to add the most important concepts that they learned and explain why they are relevant and in which contexts it should be used.

Part 2: Two measurable learning outcomes for that day’s class. I want you to imagine you are the professor for this grad seminar and think about the two most important learning outcomes you would want your students to obtain by the end of class that day.

-   What are the best frameworks to work from for different types of content (Statistics, Intro to Psy, History)

-   How to balance time spent correcting misconceptions and practice through peer interaction, with the time needed to present the content that needs to be covered 

## **Week 05**

Part 1: Two ways you plan on using the information you read about in the future. 

-   I plan on incorporating the strategies mentioned in the end of chapter 16. Offering ample feedback on initial drafts of assignments and less specific/time consuming feedback once the final draft is turned in.

-   I plan on adding an assignment to Psy 202 in which each students makes up a test question  over a chapter. Then I (or TA) will review the questions they came up with and the best will receive extra credit and be compiled into a practice test. (I got this idea from chapter 19 in the book where it mentions students being asked to formulate their own problem from the information at hand)

-   Beat the bot (stats)

Part 2: Two measurable learning outcomes for that day’s class. I want you to imagine you are the professor for this grad seminar and think about the two most important learning outcomes you would want your students to obtain by the end of class that day.

-   Describe what active learning techniques can be used in large classrooms.

-   Discuss the pros and cons of the use of some technological tools, as well as the differences between high and low stakes assignments.

Anything that made me think differently today:

When coming up with thoughtful assessment we have to discuss the content in-dept and engage with it in different ways, which is helpful. When it comes to grading, there is a hyper focus on the assessment part of class rather than the understanding and conceptualization of content

## **Week 06**

Part 1: Two ways you plan on using the information you read about in the future. 

-   I plan on making most of the points in a class associated with more deep thinking related activities, making those questions worth more in quizzes and tests

-   I plan on incorporating activities directly related to feedback, specially extensive feedback, so students will see it as relevant and incorporate it more into future activities.

Part 2: Two measurable learning outcomes for that day’s class. I want you to imagine you are the professor for this grad seminar and think about the two most important learning outcomes you would want your students to obtain by the end of class that day.

-   Design assessments that fulfill good assessment practices and have appropriate grading if any

-   Discuss the pros and cons of grades, and the different grading systems

##### **Week 07**

##### **Week 09**

##### **Week 10**

##### **Week 12**

##### **Week 13**

**Broad Notes:**

-   Impromptu for students to public speak

-   If a student is talking too much give them a job (keep track of who is participating in class).

-   Speaking tips: Don\`t put sentences down (only key words)

-   Mention Protocol

-   Dictionary definition, connotative(what it really means), Example

-   Don't embarrass people in front of other- not abuse authority- be nice

-   Since you would never pay employees in outdated currency (e.g., colonial coins), you should not grade students using past standards of achievement (Walvoord & Anderson, 1998)

-   It is imperative to think carefully about what levels of knowledge and comprehension we want tests to measure, because 91 percent of college exam questions assess lower-level comprehension rather than more complex thinking skills (Walvoord & Anderson, 1998) - and counts for 75% of the grade - implement higher levels
